<p align="center">Vision and its developers <b>take your privacy very seriously</b>.<br><br></p>
  
Beyond the information Apple provides to developers that you can decide to provide, Vision also uses [Firebase Services](https://firebase.google.com) within the app (Firebase's Privacy Policy can be [found here](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy), note that Vision only uses a small subset of Firebase's many services). This helps to better understand which features are being used (eg: if you spend more time on the main screen than others) to be able to better make development decisions and choose where to focus development effort.
The information collected is anonymous and your data isn't linked to you. Vision does not sell or rent your data, and the anonymous information is only collected to help make the app better.  
If even this collection is unfavorable to you, there's an option in the Settings tab to completely turn it off as well as an extra precaution.  
By using Vision, you're (obviously) subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/) as well as any other services/websites you visit/use within the app.
